# # Structured Corpus Processing

# There are a lot of pre-collected corpora available for linguistic studies. This section will demonstrate how we can load existing corpora in Python and perform basic corpus analysis with these data.
# 
# To facilitate the sharing of corpus data, the corpus linguistic community has now settled on a few common schemes for textual data storage and exchange. In particular, I would like to talk about the following common types of corpus data representation: 
# 
# - XML (BNC XML Edition)
# - CHILDES
# - Praat TextGrid (for spoken data)
