Introduction
============================

This notebook collects my personal python notes for linguistics. These notes are based on many different sources. Please note that these notes may have not been organized in a very systematic way.

This notebook is being updated on a regular basis. Most of the materials here are for educational purposes only.



## Table of Contents

There are four main sections in Python Notes for Linguistics:

- Python Basics
- Corpus Linguistics with Python
- Statistical Analyses
- NLP with Python

## Recommended Books


The materials collected here were based on several useful reference books, which are listed as follows in terms of three categories:

- Python Basics {cite}`gerrard2016lean`
- Data Analysis with Python {cite}`mckinney2012python`
- Natural Language Processing with Python {cite}`sarkar2019text,bird2009natural,vajjala2020,perkins2014python,srinivasa2018natural`
- Deep Learning {cite}`francois2017deep`
