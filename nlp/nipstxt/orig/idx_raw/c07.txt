Preface 
This volume contains the collected papers summarizing the talks and posters presented at 
the eighth annual conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), held in 
Denver, Colorado, from Nov. 28 to Dec. 1, 1994. The previous six volumes of Advances 
in NIPS were published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, San Francisco, California, 
while the proceedings of the first NIPS conference in 1987 were published by the 
American Institute of Physics. These volumes have been influential, and the high quality 
of papers in them has been matched by the high quality of the production. We are pleased 
that this volume is being published by MIT Press, which maintains the same exacting 
standards. 
NIPS is the longest running annual meeting devoted to neural networks and neural 
information processing. Over the years it has consistently presented research that is 
technically sound as well as topically fresh and exciting. This year's meeting certainly 
lived up to the standards set by previous meetings. In fact, two major procedural changes 
were implemented this year which we believe have resulted in even stronger technical 
presentations. First, the submissions format was changed from extended abstracts to full 
8-page papers. This gave the program committee and reviewers a better basis for making 
their acceptance decisions. Only about 1 out of 3 submitted papers was accepted for 
presentation at the conference. Second, detailed reviewer comments were returned to the 
submitting authors. Reviewer feedback was valuable in improving the presentations and 
final manuscripts of the accepted authors, and for authors whose submissions were not 
accepted, it indicated how submissions could be improved for future meetings. 
This year's papers show continued progress, and the enduring scientific and practical 
merit of the broad-based, inclusive approach towards neural networks favored by NIPS 
participants. Papers presented at NIPS freely cross traditional academic boundaries to 
draw upon many disparate domains such as neuroscience, cognitive science, computer 
science, statistics, mathematics, engineering and theoretical physics. As usual, the 
dominant component of NIPS was devoted to the study of a wide variety of learning 
algorithms and architectures, for both supervised and unsupervised learning. Topics 
attracting exceptional interest this year were the analysis of recurrent nets (Horne and 
Giles), connections to HMMs and the EM procedure (Saul and Jordan) and reinforcement 
learning algorithms and the relation to dynamic programming (Boyan and Moore). On the 
theoretical front, ample progress was reported in the theory of generalization (Kowalczyk 
and Ferra), regularization (Leen), combining multiple models (Tresp), and active learning 
(Cohn et al.). Neuroscience remained a large and vital component of NIPS, with studies 
ranging from large-scale systems such as visual cortex (Erwin and Obermayer) to single- 
cell electrotonic structure (Carnevale et al.). Work reported in cognitive science this year 
x v i i i Preface 
seemed to be more closely tied to underlying neural constraints, as seen e.g. in the paper 
of Brashers-Krug et al. on motor learning. The applications work presented at NIPS 
continues to grow in prominence and many novel applications were presented, such as 
tokamak plasma control (Bishop et al.), Glove-Talk (Fels and Hinton), and hand tracking 
(Nowlan and Platt). A variety of hardware implementations were also presented, with 
particular focus on analog VLSI (Coggins et al.; Serrano et al.). 
In addition to the main conference presentations, NIPS was fortunate to have had a 
very strong one-day tutorial program preceding the conference, chaired by Steve Hanson 
and Gerald Tesauro, and a highly popular two-day program of post-conference 
workshops in Vail, chaired by Todd Leen. The workshop program has grown in scope 
and significance to the point where it is now a valuable scientific meeting in its own right, 
and this year's program attracted a record turnout. Topics covered at the workshops 
spanned the full range of multidisciplinary approaches characteristic of NIPS. Some of 
the particularly noteworthy topics were: Unsupervised Learning Rules and Visual 
Processing, Computational Role of Lateral Connections in the Cortex, Neural Networks 
in Medicine, Time Delay Connections for Nonlinear Signal Processing, and Algorithms 
for High Dimensional Spaces. 
Organizing a conference such as NIPS is an enormous undertaking, and we would like 
to express our appreciation and gratitude to all those who volunteered their time 
(collectively totaling several thousand person-hours of labor) to help organize and run the 
meeting. Thanks go to all the members of the Organizing Committee, the Program 
Committee, the Publicity Committee, the Board of Directors of the NIPS Foundation, and 
all the referees who reviewed submissions this year. In particular, we especially thank 
Lori Pratt for a truly outstanding job organizing both the local arrangements and 
conference registration, Christy Medina and Denise Hallman, for their superb efforts as 
conference secretaries, and all the student volunteers from Colorado School of Mines and 
elsewhere. We are also grateful to Colorado School of Mines for generous financial 
support of our registration operations. Finally, we thank Barbara Yoon of the Advanced 
Projects Research Agency, Tom McKenna of the Office of Naval Research, and Captain 
Steve Suddarth of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, who once again provided 
valuable financial support that made it possible for many students and young 
investigators to attend the meeting.
