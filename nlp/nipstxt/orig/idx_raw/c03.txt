Preface 
Since its inception in 1987, the NIPS conference (short for "Neural Information Processing 
Systems - Natural and Synthetic") has attracted researchers from many disciplines who 
are applying their expertise to problems in the emerging field of neural networks. The 
conference and the following two-day workshop have become a forum for presenting to 
the neural network community the latest research results, and for leading researchers to 
gather and exchange ideas. This volume contains papers summarizing the talks and posters 
presented at the most recent NIPS conference, held in Denver, Colorado, from 26-29 
November 1990. 
The 1990 conference maintained the high level of excitement of its predecessors. Important 
new theoretical and empirical results were presented concerning the capability and gener- 
alization performance of networks. Analyses of biological nervous systems were presented 
along with mathematical models of some of these networks. Many working analog and 
digital VLSI chips were described. These chips demonstrated how rapidly VLSI design 
procedures have advanced in the past few years. New modular learning algorithms were 
also described, along with significant new industrial applications, new theoretical under- 
standing of network system design issues, and significant advances in speech, robotics, 
and machine vision systems. Many papers described the application of dynamic temporal 
networks with recurrent connections. Papers overall demonstrated a better grasp of past 
neural network research and of past theoretical and practical results in other disciplines. 
Multi-disciplinary exchange was promoted this year by grouping papers for presentation 
according to paper topic instead of by discipline. For example, one session on "Visual 
Processing" contained papers on theory, algorithms, VLSI implementation, neurobiology, 
and machine vision applications. Organization by topic instead of by discipline is reflected 
in this volume. Presentation of papers by researchers outsidetheUnited States was promoted 
this year by the addition of foreign liaisons to the conference organizing committee. Our 
current liasons represent Australia, Great Britain, continental Europe, Japan, and South 
America. Presentation of new results by students was promoted this year as in past years. 
Funds for student travel grants were provided by ATR, the Air Force Office of Scientific 
Research, Fujitsu, IBM, NASA, Sanyo, Sharp, Siemens, and the University of Colorado, 
Boulder Optoelectronic Computing Systems Center. 
The NIPS conference continues to be an exciting, successful meeting due to the continued 
efforts of a large group of people. We would first like to thank all the other members of 
the program and organizing committees who helped make this conference possible. In 
particular we would like to thank Judy Terrel for her work throughout the year as the 
conference secretary, Gina Davies and Kathy Hibbard for their work in organizing local 
arrangements and running the conference desk so smoothly, and Alex Waibel for organizing 
the post-conference workshops. Finally, we would like to thank everyone who attended 
and submitted papers and the 85 referees who carefully read and reviewed 20 papers each.
