PREFACE 
This volume contains the collected papers summarizing the talks and posters pre- 
sented at the seventh annual NIPS conference (short for Neural Information Pro- 
cessing Systems - Natural and Synthetic), held in Denver, Colorado, from November 
29th to December 2nd, 1993. It also includes short summaries of the NIPS work- 
shops held at Vail on December 3rd and 4th. 
This year's conference began on a sad note. The first president of the NIPS Foun- 
dation (see last year's preface), and the general chair of the first NIPS meeting 
held in 1987, Ed Posner, Chief Technologist of the Office of Telecommunications 
and Data Acquisition at JPL and Visiting Professor of Electrical Engineering at 
Caltech, was killed last June 15th in a traffic accident in Pasadena. His Caltech 
colleague Rod Goodman (the NIPS Treasurer) delivered the moving eulogy which 
is included in this volume. The NIPS foundation and conference owes a great debt 
to Ed Posner, who was in large part responsible for its creation and development. 
He will be greatly missed. In his place the NIPS foundation elected Terry Sejnowski 
as president. 
It is also noteworthy that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication 
of the seminal paper by McCulloch and Pitts, "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas 
Immanent in Nervous Activity", in the Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics. This 
paper initiated in large part, the entire development of the field we now call "Neural 
Networks", and in fact also greatly influenced the mathematician John yon Neu- 
mann and the other early U.S. workers who developed the general purpose digital 
computer. It is therefore fitting to find the modern computer workstation playing 
such an important role in the development of neural networks. 
This year's papers certainly reflect well the current state of development of the field. 
There are many excellent accounts of work on such diverse topics as Tonal Music 
(Stevens and Wiles), Lip Reading (Wolff et al.), Dynamic Programming (Buckland 
and Lawrence), PAC-Learning (Maass), Connectionist Models for Auditory Scene 
Analysis (Duda), Unsupervised Learning (Zemel), Odor Processing in the Bee (Lin- 
ster et al.), Visual Cortex development (Obermayer et al.), Neural Network Chips 
xvi 
(Cauwenberghs), Signature Verification (Bromley et al.), Statistical Correlations in 
Large Networks (Ginzburg and Sompolinsky), and on Recovering a Feed-forward 
Network fom its Output (Fefferman and Markel), to name but a few. 
The workshops this year were again held at Vail and chaired very effectively by 
Mike Mozer. They covered theory and applications, with emphasis on such topics as 
Attention, Robot Learning, Hippocampal Function, VLSI Implementations, Basic 
Connectionist Modelling, Computer Vision, and Visual and Auditory Processing. 
It is evident that the workshops comprise an important part of the NIPS meeting 
and serve to bring the NIPS community closer together. 
The NIPS conference brings together over 500 people and requires the hard and 
dedicated work of an exceptional group of volunteers. We would like to thank all 
the other members of the 1993 program and organizing committees who helped make 
this conference possible (they are listed elsewhere in this volume). In particular, we 
thank Chuck Anderson once again for his extraordinary efforts at local arrangments, 
and all the student volunteers fom Colorado State and UC Boulder, Davi Geiger for 
the poster, and Debbie McGougan of Caltech for her extensive work throughout the 
year as the conference secretary, and both Debbie and Denise Hallman of Colorado 
State for running the conference desk so efficiently. We also thank everyone who 
attended and/or submitted papers, and the 130 referees who carefully read and 
reviewed the 515 papers submitted this year. Finally, we wish to thank Barbara 
Yoon of the Advanced Projects Research Agency, Steve Suddarth of the Air Force 
Office of Scientific Research, and Tom McKenna of the Office of Naval Research, 
for providing NIPS with much needed financial support for many of the graduate 
students and young investigators who attended the meeting.

IN MEMORIAM 
Edward C. Posner 
1933- 1993 
XVIII 
Ed Posner 
Ed Posner, our dear friend and colleague, and Chairman of the NIPS foundation 
(the oversight body that organizes this conference), died tragically on the morning 
of June 15th 1993, just eight weeks prior to his sixtieth birthday. 
Ed was hit by a truck as he bicycled to work at JPL on the same route he had used 
for the last 30 odd years, and was killed instantly. Ed is survived by his wife Sylvia, 
and his children Joyce and Steven. 
Edward Charles Posner was a prolific and influential communications scientist and 
educator, and one of the most universally admired and respected members of the 
IEEE Communications Society. He was a founder of neural network research and 
of the NIPS conference, serving as General Chair of the 1987 conference. 
At the time of his death, Posner held the post of Chief Technologist of the Office of 
Telecommunications and Data Acquisition at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
and was also visiting Professor in Caltech's Electrical Engineering Department. 
I first met Ed in the late 70's at an information theory conference. I grew to 
respect his phenomenal organizational and human talents when we collaborated on 
the 1985 International Symposium on Information Theory in Brighton England, he 
as program chair and I as general co-chair. The last time I saw him was the night 
before the terrible accident when he handed over the NIPS accounts and check 
books to me in my office, quipped a "Posner Pun" about accounts and accountants 
which I can't remember, and went home. I didn't know him as long as some of the 
people here, but I worked with him every day since arriving at Caltech in 1985 and 
grew to realize that Ed was above all the most charming, kind, wise, witty, and 
public-spirited person that I have ever met. 
More of Ed's human qualities later, first I'd like to talk about his early days. 
Ed Posner was born August 10, 1933, in Brooklyn, N.Y. He attended New York 
City public schools and graduated first in his class, from Stuyvesant High School, 
in 1950. Paul Cohen, (winner of the Boucher Prize and the Fields Medal) and his 
lifelong school friend described how they would solve puzzles, play practical jokes, 
and compete ferociously for top of class. Early on, Ed discovered the algorithm for 
winning the game of NIM, and pretty much cleaned up on marbles in the playground 
after that. 
xx In Memoriam 
Just two short years after high school graduation, Ed received a B.A. in Physics, and 
the following year an M.S. in Mathematics, both from the University of Chicago. 
Although he spent most of his professional life closely involved in the research and 
development of communication systems, he began as a pure mathematician. In 
1957, he earned his Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Chicago, under the 
direction of Irving Kaplansky. Ed's Ph.D. thesis was entitled "Differentiably Simple 
Rings," and it was only 26 pages long, the shortest in the history of the University 
of Chicago, a fact that Ed was quite proud of. His early work in ring theory was 
very influential, and "Posner's Theorem," characterizing prime rings satisfying a 
polynomial identity, is still quoted by ring theorists. 
During his graduate studies, Ed also worked part time at Bell labs in New York 
City, his home town. Although of no obvious relevance to his career at the time, his 
work at Bell Labs was to have an important influence almost 20 years later, when he 
began serious research in traffic and switching for telephone communications, and 
the application of neural nets to telecommunications problems. Ed claimed that he 
used to sit at Nyquist's old desk at Bell Labs - perhaps that's what did it. 
After his Ph.D., for the next four years, Ed worked in academia, first as a mathe- 
matics instructor at the University of Wisconsin. A story relates that while he was 
in Wisconsin he hitched a ride with a lumber truck. In conversation, the driver 
explained he had trouble fitting all of the different types of lumber on the truck. 
Well, Ed solved a second order Diophantine equation on the spot to help him out. 
That was typical of Ed's approach to helping people - he would decide what needed 
to be done, and then do it, right then, no delay, no prevarication. 
Ed then became an assistant professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd college in 
Pasadena, and in 1960-61 also worked as a consultant at Caltech's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. 
Then In 1961, Ed Posner was hired by Sol Golomb to head the Information Pro- 
cessing Group in the Telecommunications Division at JPL. This proved to be the 
beginning of Ed's life's work. For the next 10 years, he built the group, already 
good, into one of the strongest information theory research groups in the world. 
At one time or another during his tenure, the group included Odu Adeyemi, Len 
Baumert, Elwyn Berlekamp, Hal Fredricksen, Bob Gray, A1 Hales, Larry Harper, 
Bob McEliece, Gus Solomon, Gene Rodemich, Howard Rumsey, Richard Stanley, 
Jack Stifi]er, Herb Taylor, Henk Van Tilborg, and Lloyd Welch. All, pillars of the 
information theory and communications community. The group's strength in large 
part was derived from Ed's remarkable knack of finding problems which were both 
challenging to the theorists, and useful to the project engineers. Posner's legacy 
from this period includes a very large body of theoretical work in information the- 
ory, including his own profound work, done in collaboration with Rodemich and 
Rumsey, on the epsilon entropy of random processes, as well as NASA project ap- 
plications including error control coding for telemetry and command, data frame 
synchronization, data compression systems, phased-locked loop design, and ground- 
based antenna arraying. 
After he left direct research supervision at JPL he rose up in a series of planning 
and management positions, where he was an aggressive and effective advocate for 
the importance of basic research to the long-term health of the U.S. Space Program. 
Ed Posner xxi 
At the time of his death, he was Chief Technologist for the Telecommunications and 
Data Acquisition office. His diplomatic but inflexible intolerance of shoddy work, 
his ability to cut through bureaucratic snarls, and his genius for recognizing and 
nurturing talent, helped to make JPL, and especially the Deep Space Network, one 
of the most successful large project centers in the world. Because of his influence, a 
generation of mathematicians and information theorists became welcome and useful 
contributors to the U.S. Planetary Exploration program. Ed perhaps more than any, 
was directly responsible for delivering all those exciting first close-up pictures of the 
planets to our TV screens. 
In 1970, Ed became a part-time member of the Caltech faculty, initially in the Ap- 
plied Mathematics Department. In 1972 he was recruited by John Pierce, who had 
come to Caltech himself in the previous year, to serve on the Electrical Engineer- 
ing faculty, which he continued to do until his death. He cherished his career as a 
Caltech Professor, and devoted an enormous amount of time to it, despite the fact 
that officially he held only a 50% appointment. I worked with Ed every day and in 
no way was he a "half timer". He contributed a full load at both Caltech and JPL 
- a masterpiece of time management. 
Ed supervised more than a dozen Ph.D. students, many of whom are now working 
in telecommunications research in both industry and academia. At the time of his 
death, he was supervising seven more. He was a wise and generous research adviser, 
spending countless hours helping his students with technical details, and explaining 
to them how their work fit into the larger picture of modern technology, but rarely 
allowing his name to appear on the papers that resulted from this collaboration. 
Many of Ed's students were supported by a grant from Pacific Bell, an organization 
with which Ed had developed very close and cordial ties over the past 10 years. 
Every year, he taught a popular course on Communications Traffic and Switching, 
in which he introduced students to the mathematical foundations of telephony. 
A dedicated supporter of Caltech's SURF (Summer Undergraduate Research Fel- 
lowship) program, Ed had sponsored 16 SURFers since 1984, who worked on a wide 
variety of topics from music synthesis to aids for the deaf. He also co-founded the 
SURFSAT satellite program with Robert Clauss at JPL, which aims at putting 
student projects into space. Between 1988 and 1991, he co-sponsored 20 SURFSAT 
students at JPL with Clauss. Posner had also served on the Freshman Admissions 
Committee since 1991 and the President's Fund Committee, which funds innovative 
research by Caltech faculty and students at JPL, since 1990. 
And now to Ed's scientific contribution. His research interests were remarkably 
broad. When reviewing his work I found that he had written over 200 articles for 
scientific publication. This scientific legacy speaks for itself. The topics of Ed's 
papers range from Communication Technology, to Computer Science, from Traffic 
and Transportation Technology to Neural Networks. 
His research interests at the time of his death ranged from video compression and en- 
hancement, to queueing and traffic models for new civil telecommunications services, 
and from multiple-user radio communications to planetary radar signal processing 
and neural networks. 
He began, technically, in a narrow area of mathematics, but at the end, he had a 
overall broad and deep knowledge of modern technology, especially, but not exclu- 
xxii In Memoriam 
sively, communications technology, unmatched by anyone ever I knew. When neural 
networks became important, Ed, well over 50, mastered them, and became one of 
the founding members of Caltech's Computation and Neural Systems program. By 
some miraculous internal chemistry, he was able to keep the wheels of change and 
growth turning right up to the end. I think there's a lesson there for all of us. 
Ed's neural network research was concentrated in the areas of applications of neural 
networks to communications systems, and the analysis of learning. Students that 
he advised, or helped advise, have become important young researchers in the field: 
Pierre Baldi, Tim Brown, Padhraic Smyth, and Santosh Venkatesh, to name a few. 
There is no doubt that Ed was a prime mover in our field of neural networks, and did 
everything in his power to progress the field while maintaining the highest quality, 
and the lowest profile of himself. 
My favorite paper of his is entitled "The Capacity of the Hopfield Associative Mem- 
ory." Written in collaboration with Bob McEliece, Gene Rodemich, and Santosh 
Venkatesh, they use signal to noise arguments borrowed from information theory to 
derive the incredibly elegant result that the capacity of the Hopfield net is bounded 
by N/21og N. 
By the way, Ed called his brilliant and quietly intense JPL colleague Gene Rodemich 
"The bridge." Gene could always be counted on to rescue his colleagues from the 
thorniest mathematical thicket, and Ed would often say "Whew, this is tough one. 
Let's give it to The bridge." 
In addition to his JPL duties, his academic duties, and his research, Ed was also 
involved in an amazing number of technical project collaborations. For example, 
a few weeks before his death he jointly received a patent with other colleagues for 
an electronic anti-theft device for automobiles. I myself was working with Ed on a 
technology transfer project to implement network management expert systems into 
Pacific Bell. There were many others that I heard about. Ed never thought about 
personal gain in these projects, but always about the advancement of technology, 
and that these should result in just rewards for his collaborators and Caltech. Also, 
when talking about a particular project, one always had Ed's full and complete 
attention, and received his enthusiastic and wise council. It felt like yours was the 
only project he was involved with. 
Yes, Ed had a profound impact on many of us here. But in a sense I feel that we 
have been cheated of Ed's most influential years. Ed was at the stage in his career 
where he was starting to have significant national influence on the future direction 
of science and technology in the USA. I felt certain he was headed for honors and 
awards in his mature years, though characteristically, he would never seek them. 
Well, we intend to honor Ed at this conference by dedicating our after dinner speech 
to him, henceforth to be known as the Posner Memorial Lecture. Caltech is honoring 
him by establishing a SURF endowment that will fund his cherished undergraduate 
researchers. 
I'd like to now turn to Ed's unique human qualities: his ability to recognize talent, 
make wise and accurate decisions, his punctuality, and of course - his humor. 
In places like JPL and Caltech, our continued success depends almost entirely on 
our ability to recognize and recruit talented newcomers: without them, we'd soon 
Ed Posner xxiii 
dry up and wither away. More than anyone else I ever knew, Ed had an infallible 
gift for recognizing talent. This room contains many people who were hired, or 
recruited as students, because of his influence. In this sense, he was able to amplify 
his influence, far beyond what he could have done, or what anyone could have done, 
as an individual researcher or manager. Part of this skill came, I believe, from his 
absolute ability to rise above petty jealousies, and to judge a person, even someone 
who might in some ways outshine himself, completely objectively. (This ability is 
rarer than you might think, even at Caltech.) But most of it was unexplainable and 
magical. Somehow, he was able to make amazingly accurate personnel decisions, 
and give wise accurate council, even on the basis of far too little information. 
Ed was also the most punctual man I ever met. I never knew him to be late for a 
meeting - or for that matter early. Ed had an incredible knack of arriving seconds 
before the appointed time. This had its down side. If you have ever had to catch 
a plane with Posner you know what I mean. He would budget exactly the required 
time to catch the plane, arriving minutes before departure. On the drive to the 
airport one was convinced that you were not going to make it. You always did. 
After two trips like this I (like most other mortals with nerves of less than steel) 
couldn't take it any more. I always went separately after that, arriving, unlike Ed, 
with lots of time to kill. 
And now to Ed's legendary sense of humor. I never knew a quicker wit - in fact, I 
can't even imagine a quicker wit. He truly was "the fastest pun in the West". His 
dry Brooklyn delivery was often more important that what he said; he would perch 
his glasses down on the end of his nose and look impishly around, and everyone 
would laugh in anticipation. It's little known that Ed was an active member of the 
Toastmasters and an ideal emcee. Of course we always saw him sitting right at the 
front in any technical meeting, quipping away at the speaker, being a witty session 
chairman, or injecting humor as he moderated a dry panel discussion. 
Here are a few memorable examples. 
In a seminar once, in which a student described how he was involved in the design of 
a small satellite that would be launched at no cost by NASA, Ed piped up, "there's 
gotta be a catch somewhere - there's no such thing as a free launch." 
One of his last papers, dealing with the application of information theory to a study 
of the human olfactory system, is called "A Code in the Nose." 
In describing a respected colleague who had recently found religion, Ed remarked 
"he may have been born again, but he wasn't born again yesterday." 
And of course there's his famous remark about the deep space error control project 
at JPL called the Big Viterbi Decoder, and of course shortened to BVD. The first 
time Ed heard this acronym in a meeting, he instantly remarked "we're used to 
working with hardware and software, but this is the first time we'll be working with 
underwear!" 
I don't think its too ungenerous to say that Ed was NOT always a good speaker. 
His lectures in class were sometimes very dry, and students sometimes grumbled. 
Of course Ed recognized this in himself and made fun of it. Ian Galton, a recent 
graduate student of Ed's, recounts the time that they each taught different sections 
of EEl60 during the same quarter. A student came to Ian with a note from her 
xxiv In Memoriam 
doctor and asked if she could take an incomplete in the course, because she had 
chronic insomnia which made it difficult for her to work. When Ian mentioned this 
to Ed, without missing a beat he said "have her switch to my section - I'll put her 
to sleep." 
Yes, he was a great wit, but he was not a clown. Just the opposite. He never took 
himself seriously, but everyone else learned to take him very seriously indeed. When 
Ed spoke, people listened. What I will miss most about him, I think, is his wise 
counsel, always immensely helpful, but always dispensed with a twinkle in his eye. 
I walk past his office every day, and I still half-expect to see him pop out of the 
office and say surprise! It was all a bad dream. Dammit Ed why couldn't you have 
been 5 minutes late for once in your life on that terrible day. Well, someday June 
15, 1993, will be a long time ago, and we'll all feel better about this terrible tragedy 
than we do now. Our grief will fade, but our memories of Ed will not. What we'll 
remember, what I'll remember is that he was a witty, wise, kind, patient, self-aware, 
and deeply committed man. Above all, I'll remember, and be proud, that he was 
my friend. 
Thank you Ed for being here for us, and I know that if you could give us one last 
word, it would be your favorite parting phrase - CARRY ON!
