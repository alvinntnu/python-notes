Preface 
This volume contains the collected papers of the 1989 IEEE Conference on Neural In- 
formation Processing Systems-Natural and Synthetic, held November 27-30, 1989, in 
Denver, Colorado. 
Neural networks are often described as an enthusiastically interdisciplinary field. A 
reliable sign that one has embarked on a course of truly interdisciplinary research is the 
discovery that one can't understand what most of one's colleagues are talking about. 
Previous NIPS conferences brought together physicists, biologists, computer scientists, 
and engineers to discuss their respective research programs, but each spoke mostly in his 
or her "native" language. It was difficult to pursue multi-disciplinary conversations to 
any great depth. 
In Denver this past November, the situation appeared to have changed. People were 
talking to each other more easily than in the past. It seems we've all been busy learning 
about each other's specialties, aided periodically by direct exposure at conferences such 
as this. A related feature of this year's conference was an increase in reports of interdis- 
ciplinary collaborations. I hope I'm not being too optimistic when I say that the news 
from NIPS-89 is that our field is maturing. 
The papers in this volume are organized into ten parts. Part I, Neuroscience, includes 
some stunning demonstrations of the interaction of computational modeling techniques 
with classical neuroscience. One example is the paper by Lockery et al. on distributed 
representations in the leech. Some major application areas are covered in Part II, Speech 
and Sigual Processing, Part III, Vision, and Part IV, Optimization and Control. Part V, 
Other Applications, spans a wide range of topics, from natural language processing to 
character recoguition. An impressive handwritten digit recognizer developed at Bell Labs 
was demonstrated live, in real time, at the conference. It is described in the paper by 
LeCun et al. 
Part VI offers a collection of new learning algorithms. Several papers describe network- 
growing algorithms, in which new units or connections are added dynamically to produce 
a network just large enough to solve a particular supervised learning problem. There are 
papers on unsupervised learning as well. Part VII presents empirical analyses of various 
networks' behavior, while Part VIII is devoted to theoretical analyses. Part IX, Hardware 
Implementation, is concerned both with analog VLSI implementation of neural circuitry 
and with the simulation of networks on digital parallel processors. 
At the conference banquet, Jack Cowan of the University of Chicago gave a delightful 
after-dinner speech on the early days of neural networks. As someone who knew many 
of the pioneering figures personally and made important contributions of his own to the 
field, he is in a unique position to tell young scientists what things were like in the 
"pre-Perceptrons" period from 1943 to 1968. Professor Cowan kindly agreed to put his 
historical and personal observations from that evening into print, and they are included 
here as Part X.

I would like to congratulate my colleagues on the NIPS-89 organizing and program 
committees for their success in putting together such a first rate conference, especially 
General Chairman Scott Kirkpalrick and Program Chair Rich Lippmann. Shirley Jowell 
at Morgan Kaufmann was primarily responsible for the smooth and rapid production of 
this volume; it is always a pleasure to work with her. Thanks also to Chris McConnell, 
a graduate student here at Carnegie Mellon, for preparing the subject index. 
One never knows what exciting developments will surface at next year's neural net con- 
ferences. Many of us are already looking forward with anticipation to our return to 
Denver in November. We hope to see you there.
