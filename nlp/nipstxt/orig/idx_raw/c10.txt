Preface 
The papers in this volume describe the work presented at the Eleventh Annual Conference 
on Neural Information Processing (NIPS), held in Denver, Colorado from December 1 to 
December 6, 1997. The usual competitive standards for acceptance held again, with the 
150 papers presented having been selected from 491 submissions. 
NIPS is arguably one of the strongest and most ambitious interdisciplinary conferences, 
consistently bringing together top researchers in computer science, neuroscience, physics, 
statistics, and many related areas. The unifying topics are broad, such as the study of the 
brain, or interest in biological or computational mechanisms for learning. With such di- 
verse participants and such large themes, it is natural to ask what holds NIPS together, and 
how it became the central technical gathering for so many of its participants. One way of 
expressing the answer is to say that the "relatedness graph" of the work presented at NIPS 
is not a clique, but is strongly connected. Thus, while it is an easy task to find two papers in 
these proceedings and ask how in the world they came to lie in the same volume, that same 
challenge can be met by a list of other papers that fill in the scientific "distance" between the 
initial pair. Thus the entry "Spectrotemporal Receptive Fields for Neurons in the Primary 
Auditory Cortex of the Awake Primate" (DeCharms and Merzenich), which describes the 
application of a clever reverse correlation technique to identify receptive fields for auditory 
neurons, is related in statistical spirit to "Using Helmholtz Machines to Analyze Multi- 
Channel Neuronal Recordings" (De Sa, DeCharms, and Merzenich), which models spike 
train data with multilayer generative models. This latter paper, in turn, shares an interest 
in hidden-variable representations of probability distributions with "A Revolution: Belief 
Propagation in Graphs with Cycles" (Frey and MacKay); which then has a common interest 
in information theory with 'l'he Canonical Distortion Measure in Feature Space and 1-NN 
Classification" (Baxter and Bartlet0. The point is not that the bonds between adjacent pa- 
pers in this sequence are inherent and unbreakable; rather, it is that although the first and 
last papers are on rather different topics and from rather different communities, one can 
see how the interests of a single researcher might easily straddle any one of the links. We 
leave it as exercises for the ambitious reader to construct similar paths between "A Neural 
Network Model of Naive Preference and Filial Imprinting in the Domestic Chick" (Had- 
den) and "Phase Transitions and Perceptual Organization of Video Sequences" (Weiss), 
and between "Modeling Seasonality and Trends in Daily Rainfall Data" (Williams) and 
"Extended ICA Removes Artifacts in White Blood Cell Identification" (Song et al.). While 
we have not worked these particular examples out, we are confident that reasonably short 
solutions exist. 
In addition to the strong program of submitted papers, the conference also featured a lively 
schedule of invited speakers. Ken Nakayama of Harvard gave the banquet talk on "Psy- 
chological Studies of Visual Perception", and invited talks were given by Yoav Freund of 
AT&T Labs ("Boosting: A New Method for Combining Classifiers"), John Hopfield of 
Princeton University ("Computing with Action Potentials"), John Kauer of Tufts Univer- 
sity ("Odor Encoding by the Olfactory System m from Biology to a Receptorless Artifi- 
cial Nose"), Stuart Russell of U.C. Berkeley ("Learning in Rational Agents"), and Man- 
fred Warmuth of U.C. Santa Cruz ("Relative Loss Bounds, the Minimum Relative Entropy 
Principle, and EM"). As is traditional, the main conference was again preceded by a day of 
tutorials introducing current topics of interest to the uninitiated, and followed by two days 
of intensive workshops on a collection of topics that again reflects the focused diversity 
xiv Preface 
that is the strength of NIPS. 
The continued success of NIPS is the result of many hours of hard work by a large and 
distributed group of devoted individuals. We extend many thanks to the members of the 
organizing committee, the program committee, the publicity committee and the NIPS Foun- 
dation board. Special gratitude is due to the referees, whose efforts are clearly shown in 
the quality of the papers gathered here. Thanks to the workshop chairs Steven Nowlan and 
Richard Zemel, tutorials chair Satinder Singh, publicity chair Tony Bell, treasurer Bartlett 
Mel, and local arrangements chair Amn Jagota. A special thanks to Thomas Petsche, who 
in his role of Publication Chair for NIPS*96 developed an excellent and comprehensive 
set of formatting tools for the production of both the Conference Program and the NIPS 
Proceedings. Finally, many thanks to Denise Prell of Conference Consulting Associates 
for her excellent and professional work, and to the many student volunteers who helped 
with conference logistics. We are also grateful to the Office of Naval Research for provid- 
ing financial support to allow many graduate students and young investigators to attend the 
meeting.
