PREFACE 
This volume contains 144 papers summarizing the talks and posters presented at the fifth 
NIPS conference (short for "Neural Information Processing Systems--Natural and Syn- 
thetic"), held in Denver, Colorado, from 2-5 December 1991. Since its inception in 1987, 
the NIPS conference has attracted researchers from many disciplines who are applying their 
expertise to problems in the field of neural networks. The conference and the following 
two-day workshop have become a forum for presenting the latest research results and for 
leading researchers to gather and exchange ideas. 
The 1991 conference maintained the high level of excitement of its predecessors. 
Important new theoretical results were presented concerning the capability and generaliza- 
tion performance of networks. Of particular interest are papers included in this volume by 
Vapnik, MacKay, Haussler, and others, which describe how to relate the complexity of 
networks to generalization performance on unseen test data. Many new network architec- 
tures were described. Some integrate expert system rules with networks, build hierarchies of 
networks, use radial basis function hidden nodes, and impose pre-specified invariance on the 
final solution. Neurobiological papers analyzed and modeled neurons in the hippocampus, in 
cat striate cortex, and in the blowfly. They also modeled biological networks that control eye 
movement, form topological maps, and compensate for head movement. Successful applica- 
tions of neural networks were described in the areas of speech, vision, language, control, 
medical monitoring, and system diagnostics. Of particular interest was a paper by Tesauro, 
which demonstrated how a network could be trained to play backgammon at an expert level; 
papers by Jain, Watrous, and Giles, which described approaches to learning grammars; 
hybrid hidden-Markov-model/neural-network speech recognizers described by Haffner, 
Levin, Singer, Renals, and Bengio; papers on optical character recognition; a paper by Jabri, 
which describes a network to control a wearable heart defibrillator; a paper by Smyth for 
diagnosis of large-dish antenna pointing systems; and a paper by R/Sscheisen concerning 
control of force on rollers in steel rolling mills. Papers also described new analog and digital 
VLSI chips, systems for neural network implementation, and compared neural network and 
statistical approaches to pattern classification. 
An historical milestone was reached this year, NIPS-91 was the fifth NIPS conference 
since the first conference was held in 1987. To mark this anniversary, we decided to review 
the history of events that led to the foundation of the NIPS conference and to discuss the 
evolution of the conference since its foundation. The following history is based in part on 
the recollections of Jim Bower, Larry Jackel, and Ed Posner. Some of this history was pre- 
sented by Larry Jackel at the opening banquet. 
While the first NIPS conference met in 1987, its origins can be traced back to the 
"Hopfest" meetings named in honor of John Hopsfield, held at Caltech. The first few, 
1984-1986, were organized by Ed Posner of Caltech. These meetings met in the fall and 
included researches mainly from the Caltech campus and JPL. In 1985, Larry Jackel of Bell 
Labs and Demetri Psaltis of Caltech organized the first of what were to become the "Snow- 
bird" meetings. The meetings were intended to be small informal workshops and convened 
in Santa Barbara. Twenty people were invited, but news of the meeting spread by word of 
mouth, so that attendance ended up growing to 60. In 1986, the meeting reconvened at 
Snowbird, which offered better snow conditions. Jackel, Psaltis, and the other organizers 
intended to keep the attendance down to 100 people, but the interest was so great that many 
people were turned away even after the attendance was capped at 160. The first Snowbird 
proceedings was edited by John Denker of Bell Labs and published by the American Institute 
of Physics (ALP) press. 
In 1986, the Snowbird meeting was the only neural network conference, and it clearly 
could not accommodate the exploding numbers of researchers becoming interested in the 
field and still maintain the character of a small workshop. To respond to demand, the 
organizers decided to make Snowbird a more dosed meeting, but to set in motion organiza- 
tion of a large meeting that would be open to all interested. The goal was to have a non. 
commercial meeting, dedicated to scholarship, which would capture some of the flavor of tle 
workshop. The Snowbird organizers nominated a committee with Ed Posner as General 
Chairman and Yaser Abu Mostafa as Program Chairman (both of Caltech), to organize and 
run the 1987 NIPS conference, which was officially sponsored by the IEEE Information 
Theory Society. Denver was chosen as the site due to its central geographical location, ease of 
access by air, and close proximity to the mountains and the University of Colorado at 
Boulder. 
The 1987 organizers designed the NIPS conference to have many of the advantages of a 
workshop, while still accommodating a large audience. To maximize scientific interchange, 
they decided to limit the oral presentations to a single stream, have posters be the majority of 
presentations, and include poster preview as well as formal poster sessions. Furthermore, a set 
of post-conference workshops was organized at the Copper Mountain ski resort after the 
main conference to enable small groups to discuss specific topics. The 1987 conference 
proved to be a great success, with about 450 attendees and 91 papers making it into th 
proceedings. Dana Z. Anderson of CU Boulder edited the proceedings, which were pub- 
lished by the AlP press and are now informally known as NIPS Volume 0. 
Since 1987, some changes and refinements have been made, but the basic structure of 
the conference has remained the same. The NIPS 1988 proceedings (NIPS Volume 1, edited 
by David Tourestzky of Carnegie Mellon) were the first published by Morgan Kaufmann. 
Also in 1988, the post-conference workshops were moved to Keystone, CO. The refinement 
processes (three reviewers instead of two), a more cross-disciplinary grouping of presenta- 
tions, finer presentation catagories, and the addition of five-minute oral poster spotlight 
presentations. A major and very successful addition to the 1991 conference was the introduc- 
tion of a day of tutorials preceding the main conference. The 1991 workshops were held at 
Vail, which proved to ba a popular move. 
Finally, 1991 marked the drafting of articles of incorporation for the Neural Informa- 
tion Processing Systems Foundation, which will be responsible for the continuity of the 
NIPS conference in future years. The initial board of directors of the foundation consists of 
the 1987 to 1992 NIPS General Chairs (Ed Posner of Cal Tech, Terry Sejnowski of the Salk 
Institute and UCSD, Scott Kirkpatrick of IBM, Richard Lippmann of MIT Lincoln Labs, 
John Moody of Yale, and Stephen Hanson of Siemens), a member of the IEEE Information 
Theory Society (Terry Fine of Cornell), and our legal counsel (Philip Sotel). 
The NIPS conference continues to be an exciting, successful meeting due to the efforts 
of a large group of people. We would first like to thank all the other members of the 1991 
program and organizing committees who helped make this conference possible, In particular, 
we would like to thank Renate Crowley of Siemens for her extensive work throughout the 
year as the conference secretary and both Renate and Kate Fuqua of CU Boulder for running 
the conference desk so smoothly. Student contributions are an important part of the NIPS 
program, and we gratefully thank Tom McKenna of ONR and Steve Suddarth of AFOSR 
for the student travel funding provided by their agencies. Finally, we thank everyone who 
attended and submitted papers and the 105 referees who carefully read and reviewed 20 
papers each.
